## checking mcp connection
Can you see the Figma page designs I have, in the Pocket Heist project?
---
Can you update the btn class in this project, to match the design of the ButtonComponent in the design. Also, in the case of the button in the @components/Navbar.tsx component, can you add the + icon?

## firebase setup (run firebase init command)
I already have a Firebase project created with the id of pocket-heist-ninja, with the firestore and auth services enabled. Can you register a new app in the project and pull down the setup code for the application.

## SPEC: firebase auth and user object
/spec I want to hook the signup form in @app/(public)/signup/ to firebase auth, using @lib/firebase.ts exports. I also want it so that upon succesful signup with the auth service, we then set the displayName of the user - which should be randomly generated by picking a word from 3 different sets of words and jamming them together in PascalCase. Once the whole thing is complete, the user should be redirected to the /heists page. Only use the firebase web sdk. 

## SPEC: firebase logout functionality
/spec can we spec the logout functionality, where a user clicks a button in the navbar (which only shows when logged in) to log out, and then get's redirected to the /login page. Figma: style the logout button as per the OutlineButton component in the navbar of the design.

## SPEC: firebase login functionality
/spec can we spec the login form functionality - users should be logged in with the correct credentials, and then redirected to the /heists page when done.
