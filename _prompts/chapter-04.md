## checking mcp connection
Can you see the Figma page designs I have, in the Pocket Heist project?
---
Can you update the btn class in this project, to match the design of the ButtonComponent in the design. Also, in the case of the button in the @components/Navbar.tsx component, can you add the + icon?

## firebase setup (run firebase init command)
I already have a Firebase project created with the id of pocket-heist-ninja, with the firestore and auth services enabled. Can you register a new app in the project and pull down the setup code for the application.

## SPEC: Auth state management
/spec let's spec an auth state management solution for the app, where we can access the current user (null if logged out, the user object if logged in) - maybe through a hook called useUser. We should be able to use that hook in any page or component. Then we can update any place in components which currently accesses the user. Do not implement any signup/login/logout flow yet - just a realtime global listener to update user status. Use auth exports from @auth/firebase.ts.

## SPEC: firebase signup
/spec I want to hook the signup form in @app/(public)/signup/ to firebase auth, using @lib/firebase.ts exports. I also want it so that upon succesful signup with the auth service, we then set the displayName of the user - which should be randomly generated by picking a word from 3 different sets of words and jamming them together in PascalCase. The user should also have a document created in a 'users' collection, to store their displayName (call it codename). Only use the firebase web sdk.

## SPEC: firebase logout functionality
/spec can we spec the logout functionality, where a user clicks a button in the navbar (which only shows when logged in) to log out, and then get's redirected to the /login page. Figma: style the logout button as per the OutlineButton component in the navbar of the design.
---

## SPEC: firebase login functionality
/spec can we spec the login form functionality - users should be logged in with the correct credentials, and then redirected to the /heists page when done. let's also conditionally show the user's displayName (codename) in the navbar to the left of the logout button.
---

## SPEC: protected routes
/spec let's spec out how to protect pages depending on the auth status of the user. Pages in the (public) group should only be viewable to unauthenticated users, and pages in the (dashboard) group should only be viewable to authenticated users. Use the useUser hook to conditionally redirect users. Let's also show a very simple loader in the layouts until the auth status is identified from firebase and the redirects kick in.
